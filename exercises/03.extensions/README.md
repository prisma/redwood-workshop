Intro
=====
Our company is saved and (more importantly) our database is happy. Now that we're DB experts, let's expand our use of Prisma to solve some other problems in our backlog. Happy Coding!

For this exercise, the following resources will be handy:
- [Prisma guides](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides)
- [Prisma Client extensions docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions)

Exercise
========
For this exercise, we'll be making a Prisma Client extension. What you make is up to you!

We have a great [repo of examples](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-extensions) that you can use as a starting point or inspiration for what you build.
